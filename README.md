# An Adventurer
## About
The game An Adventurer is a basic text-based game that will present the player with a setting, and present four options from which the player may select. Each selection will continue the narrative of the game, but only one combination of selections will bring the player from the beginning to the end of the narrative. Each wrong selection will end the game, and give the player the option to revert back a move. A score will be awarded to players based on how many turns it takes to get to the end of the game.
## User Experience
- On the homepage, the user will be prompted to create a profile.
- Users will login to the game and be presented with a homescreen that gives the options to play, logout, and view scores.
- If users select view scores, they will be presented with the ten highest scores in the game.
- If users select to play, they will be presented with a quick narrative about their current situation, and presented with four options to select based on their situation.
- When the character reaches the end or is eliminated, they will be presented with their score and the option to return to their last position.
## Application Features
- MySQL database containing all user scores.
- Web server build with Node and Express.
- Built and stylized with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
## Current State of Application Development
I have been playing catch-up for most of this class as I have no experience in Javascript, HTML, CSS, Vscode, Github, and basically everything we are doing. So I know I have not implemented much, and any help would be appreciated, but I must admit, this project has kind of creeped up on me so I know I am behind.
